General Procedures

All reagents were lyophilized overnight before use. 1 equivalent PMDA (3.00 mol% mol/L) and 1 equivalent ODA (3.00 mol%) were dissolved in IL and stirred under argon protection at room temperature. Base was added subsequently into the solution. The crude product was filtered out, washed 5 times by water or methanol and then dried in an air oven for 4 hours.

All the reactions were first performed with fresh base-IL medium so as to reach the saturation of product. The yields then were determined in the reuse of the "old" medium.

Methods

Determination of molar mass was performed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Autoflex III mass spectrometer (Bruker) in linear, positive ion mode with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Samples for the mass spectrometry were prepared by dissolving the product (0.10 mg) in DMAc (5.0 mL) at 40°C and then adding 100 µL of this solution to a water/acetonitrile mixture (50:50, 900 µL). The resulting sample was filtered through a 0.02 µm PTFE membrane and injected at a flow rate of 5 µL/min.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured by using a Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker).

Gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis was performed on an Agilent PL GPC 220 instrument equipped with a Waters 2414 detector and 2 PolarGel-M 10μm columns. All GPC analyses were performed using a DMF solution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 60 °C and calibrated with polystyrene standards. Samples for GPC analysis were prepared by dissolving the product (0.1 mg) in DMAc with 0.1% LiBr (5.0 mL) at 40°C and filtered through a 0.02 μm PTFE membrane prior to injection.

Tg was measured by using a DSC instrument (Pyris 6, Perkin Elmer). Sample weighed 10.0 mg and the analysis was carried out at a 10 °C/min heating rate under nitrogen purge (25 mL/min). Temperature and heat flow were calibrated using indium and zinc standards.

A TGA instrument (Pyris 6, Perkin Elmer) was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the polyimides. The analysis was carried out at a 10 °C/min heating rate under nitrogen purge (25 mL/min). The weight loss signal was detected as a function of time and temperature.
