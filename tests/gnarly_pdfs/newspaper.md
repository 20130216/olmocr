UNITED STATES BATTLESHIP OREGON, AT ANCHOR OFF THE HARBOR.

After her second International cruise, the famous battleship Oregon, the pride of the American navy, is again at anchor in Honolulu harbor. She arrived yesterday morning from San Francisco, and will remain here for several days, taking on coal and supplies before proceeding to Manila. The Oregon is commanded by Captain Wilde, and has on board a full complement of officers and men. The ship is in splendid condition, and her officers speak in the highest terms of her seaworthiness and fighting qualities.

The Oregon is one of the most famous ships in the American navy. She was built at the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, and was launched in 1893. Her displacement is 10,288 tons, length 348 feet, beam 69 feet, and mean draft 24 feet. Her engines develop 11,000 horsepower, giving her a speed of 16 knots. She carries four 13-inch guns, eight 8-inch, and four 6-inch rapid-fire guns, besides a secondary battery of smaller pieces.

The Oregon first came into prominence during the Spanish-American war. At the outbreak of hostilities she was at Bremerton, Washington, and was ordered to join the Atlantic fleet. Her famous run from the Pacific to the Atlantic, around Cape Horn, was one of the most remarkable feats in naval history. She left San Francisco March 19, 1898, and arrived at Jupiter Inlet, Florida, May 24, having steamed over 14,000 miles in 66 days. She joined Admiral Sampson's fleet off Santiago, and took a prominent part in the destruction of Cervera's squadron.

Since the war, the Oregon has been engaged in various cruises, and has visited many ports in the Pacific and Atlantic. She was at Manila during the Philippine insurrection, and has since made a cruise to China and Japan. Her officers and crew are proud of her record, and she is everywhere received with enthusiasm.

The Oregon is a favorite with the people of Honolulu, and her arrival is always an event of interest. During her stay here, she will be visited by large numbers of residents and tourists, who will be given every opportunity to inspect the famous battleship.
