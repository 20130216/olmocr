UNITED STATES BATTLESHIP OREGON, AT ANCHOR OFF THE HARBOR.

After her second international cruise, the famous battleship Oregon, the “Bull Dog of the Sea,” is again at anchor in Honolulu harbor. She arrived yesterday morning from Hongkong, via Nagasaki, Yokohama, and Guam, and will remain here for several days, taking on coal and supplies before proceeding to San Francisco. The Oregon is one of the most celebrated ships in the American navy, her record in the Spanish-American war having made her a household word throughout the United States.

The Oregon was sighted off Koko Head early yesterday morning, and steamed into the harbor shortly after 9 o’clock. She was greeted by the usual salutes and the cheers of the people who had gathered along the waterfront to witness her arrival. The ship presents a splendid appearance, her immense steel hull and powerful guns giving her an air of invincibility. The officers and men are in excellent health and spirits, and all express themselves as delighted to be once more in Hawaiian waters.

The Oregon’s cruise has been a long and eventful one, having left San Francisco more than a year ago for the Asiatic station. She has visited many ports in the Far East, including Manila, Hongkong, Nagasaki, and Yokohama, and has taken part in several important naval maneuvers. The ship is now on her way home, and will proceed to Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs and refitting.

The officers of the Oregon are as follows: Captain Wilde, commanding; Lieutenant Commander Pollock, executive officer; Lieutenant Evans, navigator; Paymaster Murphy; Chief Engineer Bates; and others. The crew numbers about 450 men, including marines and bluejackets.

During her stay in port, the Oregon will be open to visitors at certain hours, and it is expected that a large number of people will take advantage of the opportunity to inspect the famous battleship. The officers will be entertained by the local officials and residents, and several social functions are being arranged in their honor.

The Oregon will probably sail for San Francisco early next week, and will be accompanied out of the harbor by the usual escort of launches and small boats. Her visit is an event of great interest to the people of Honolulu, and she will carry with her the best wishes of all for a safe and pleasant voyage home.
