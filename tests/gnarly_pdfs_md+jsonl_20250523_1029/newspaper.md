UNITED STATES BATTLESHIP OREGON, AT ANCHOR OFF THE HARBOR.

After her second memorable cruise around the world, the United States battleship Oregon, the “Bull Dog of the Sea,” is again at anchor in Honolulu harbor. The Oregon, which left San Francisco on March 19, 1898, for her famous run around South America to join the North Atlantic squadron, has since that time been almost constantly in commission, and has covered more miles than any other battleship in the American navy. She has become a household word in every American home, and her record is one of which every American may well be proud.

The Oregon is a first-class battleship of 10,288 tons displacement, 348 feet long, 69 feet beam, and 24 feet 6 inches draft. Her engines develop 11,000 horse power, and her speed is 16 knots. She carries four 13-inch, eight 8-inch, and four 6-inch guns, besides a secondary battery of rapid-fire guns and torpedo tubes. Her complement is 32 officers and 434 men.

The Oregon was built at the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, and was launched October 26, 1893. She was commissioned July 15, 1896, and was assigned to the Pacific station. On March 19, 1898, she left San Francisco under orders to join the North Atlantic squadron, and made her famous run around Cape Horn, arriving at Jupiter Inlet, Florida, May 24, 1898, after a run of 14,000 miles in 66 days, the longest and fastest cruise ever made by a battleship. She joined Admiral Sampson’s fleet off Santiago, Cuba, and took a prominent part in the destruction of Cervera’s fleet on July 3, 1898. The Oregon’s performance in that battle won her the title of “Bull Dog of the Sea,” and her name became a synonym for American naval prowess.

After the war, the Oregon was ordered to the Asiatic station, and has since been cruising in Chinese and Japanese waters. She was at Manila during the Philippine insurrection, and has visited nearly every port of importance in the Far East. She left Hongkong on May 1, and arrived at Honolulu yesterday morning, after a run of 3,500 miles in 15 days.

The officers of the Oregon are: Captain George W. Coffin, commanding; Lieutenant Commander Charles E. Fox, executive officer; Lieutenants Waldo Evans, Charles S. Williams, and others; Surgeon Charles F. Stokes; Paymaster Charles W. Laird; Chief Engineer Charles W. Parks; and a full complement of junior officers and warrant officers.

The Oregon will remain in port for several days, taking on coal and supplies, and giving her crew a much-needed rest. She will then proceed to San Francisco, where she will be docked and overhauled.
