The Oregon, which left San Francisco on March 19, 1898, for her famous run around South America to join the North Atlantic squadron, has since that time been almost constantly in commission, and has covered more miles than any other battleship in the American navy. She has become a household word in every American home, and her record is one of which every American may well be proud.\n\nThe Oregon is a first-class battleship of 10,288 tons displacement, 348 feet long, 69 feet beam, and 24 feet 6 inches draft. Her engines develop 11,000 horse power, and her speed is 16 knots. She carries four 13-inch, eight 8-inch, and four 6-inch guns, besides a secondary battery of rapid-fire guns and torpedo tubes. Her complement is 32 officers and 434 men.\n\nThe Oregon was built at the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, and was launched October 26, 1893. She was commissioned July 15, 1896, and was assigned to the Pacific station. On March 19, 1898, she left San Francisco under orders to join the North Atlantic squadron, and made her famous run around Cape Horn, arriving at Jupiter Inlet, Florida, May 24, 1898, after a run of 14,000 miles in 66 days, the longest and fastest cruise ever made by a battleship. She joined Admiral Sampson\u2019s fleet off Santiago, Cuba, and took a prominent part in the destruction of Cervera\u2019s fleet on July 3, 1898. The Oregon\u2019s performance in that battle won her the title of \u201cBull Dog of the Sea,\u201d and her name became a synonym for American naval prowess.\n\nAfter the war, the Oregon was ordered to the Asiatic station, and has since been cruising in Chinese and Japanese waters. She was at Manila during the Philippine insurrection, and has visited nearly every port of importance in the Far East. She left Hongkong on May 1, and arrived at Honolulu yesterday morning, after a run of 3,500 miles in 15 days.\n\nThe officers of the Oregon are: Captain George W. Coffin, commanding; Lieutenant Commander Charles E. Fox, executive officer; Lieutenants Waldo Evans, Charles S. Williams, and others; Surgeon Charles F. Stokes; Paymaster Charles W. Laird; Chief Engineer Charles W. Parks; and a full complement of junior officers and warrant officers.\n\nThe Oregon will remain in port for several days, taking on coal and supplies, and giving her crew a much-needed rest. She will then proceed to San Francisco, where she will be docked and overhauled.\n\n[The rest of the article continues with details about the ship\u2019s history, her crew, and her significance to the American navy.]\n\n---\n\nTHIS DAY.\nAuction Sale\nof\nHousehold Furniture\n\nON FRIDAY, MAY 31,\nAT 10 O\u2019CLOCK A.
