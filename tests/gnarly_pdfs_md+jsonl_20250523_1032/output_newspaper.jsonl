The Oregon arrived yesterday morning from San Francisco, and will remain here for several days, taking on coal and supplies before proceeding to Manila.\n\nThe Oregon is one of the best known ships in the world, and her record is one of which every American is justly proud. She is the ship that made the memorable run from the Pacific to the Atlantic at the outbreak of the Spanish-American war, and her arrival at Key West was the signal for a great outburst of enthusiasm. The Oregon\u2019s dash around the Horn, covering over 14,000 miles in sixty-six days, was one of the most remarkable performances in naval history, and her subsequent participation in the battle of Santiago, where she played a leading part in the destruction of Cervera\u2019s fleet, added to her fame.\n\nSince that time the Oregon has been in various parts of the world, and her name is a household word wherever the American flag floats. She is a first-class battleship of 10,288 tons displacement, 348 feet long, 69 feet beam, and 24 feet draft. Her engines develop 11,000 horsepower, giving her a speed of 16 knots. She carries four 13-inch guns, eight 8-inch, and four 6-inch, besides a secondary battery of smaller guns. Her complement is 32 officers and 434 men.\n\nThe Oregon is commanded by Captain Thomas, who has with him a full complement of officers and men. The officers are as follows:\n\nCaptain\u2014Charles E. Vreeland.\nLieutenant Commander\u2014W. H. Allen.\nLieutenants\u2014J. H. Gibbons, C. S. Williams, W. S. Sims, W. L. Rodgers, W. S.
