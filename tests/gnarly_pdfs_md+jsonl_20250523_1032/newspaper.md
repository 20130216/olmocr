UNITED STATES BATTLESHIP OREGON AT ANCHOR OFF THE HARBOR.

After her second International cruise, the famous battleship Oregon, the “Bull Dog of the Sea,” is again at anchor off the harbor, and Honolulu is once more honored by the presence of the most famous fighting ship in the American navy. The Oregon arrived yesterday morning from San Francisco, and will remain here for several days, taking on coal and supplies before proceeding to Manila.

The Oregon is one of the best known ships in the world, and her record is one of which every American is justly proud. She is the ship that made the memorable run from the Pacific to the Atlantic at the outbreak of the Spanish-American war, and her arrival at Key West was the signal for a great outburst of enthusiasm. The Oregon’s dash around the Horn, covering over 14,000 miles in sixty-six days, was one of the most remarkable performances in naval history, and her subsequent participation in the battle of Santiago, where she played a leading part in the destruction of Cervera’s fleet, added to her fame.

Since that time the Oregon has been in various parts of the world, and her name is a household word wherever the American flag floats. She is a first-class battleship of 10,288 tons displacement, 348 feet long, 69 feet beam, and 24 feet draft. Her engines develop 11,000 horsepower, giving her a speed of 16 knots. She carries four 13-inch guns, eight 8-inch, and four 6-inch, besides a secondary battery of smaller guns. Her complement is 32 officers and 434 men.

The Oregon is commanded by Captain Thomas, who has with him a full complement of officers and men. The officers are as follows:

Captain—Charles E. Vreeland.
Lieutenant Commander—W. H. Allen.
Lieutenants—J. H. Gibbons, C. S. Williams, W. S. Sims, W. L. Rodgers, W. S. Cowles.
Ensigns—C. S. Freeman, H. H. Rousseau, W. S. Pye, H. H. Hough.
Naval Cadets—J. H. Klein, J. H. Hoover, J. H. Oliver, J. H. Lofland.
Surgeon—C. F. Stokes.
Assistant Surgeon—C. H. T. Lowndes.
Paymaster—C. W. Littlefield.
Chief Engineer—J. K. Baxter.
Passed Assistant Engineer—J. H. Glennon.
Assistant Engineers—J. H. Gibbons, J. H. Oliver, J. H. Lofland.
Chaplain—C. S. Freeman.
Marine Officer—J. H. Hoover.

The Oregon will remain in port for several days, and during her stay will be visited by large numbers of people, who will take advantage of the opportunity to see the famous battleship.
